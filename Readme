This is a simple Python program for a Magic Number Guessing Game. In this game, the computer randomly selects a magic number between 1 and 50, and the player's goal is to guess the magic number with the fewest attempts.

Code Explanation

Here's how the code works:
  Import the random module to generate a random magic number.
  Generate a random magic number between 1 and 50 and store it in the magic variable.
  Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of attempts the player makes.
  The game then enters a loop that continues until the player guesses the correct number. Within the loop:
    Increment the count variable by 1 to keep track of the number of attempts.
    Prompt the user to enter their guess with the input function. The entered value is converted to an integer and stored in the user variable.
    Compare the user's guess with the magic number using if, elif, and else statements.
    If the user's guess is lower than the magic number, a message is printed indicating that the guess is too low.
    If the user's guess is higher than the magic number, a message is printed indicating that the guess is too high.
    If the user's guess matches the magic number, a congratulations message is printed, along with the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
    The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number, at which point the break statement is used to exit the loop and end the game.

How to Play
  Run the Python program.
  The program will generate a random magic number between 1 and 50.
  You will be prompted to enter your guess.
  Enter your guess and press Enter.
  The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
  Repeat steps 3-5 until you correctly guess the magic number.
  Once you guess the correct number, the program will display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly, and the game will end.

Enjoy playing the Magic Number Guessing Game!
